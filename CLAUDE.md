### Key Design Principles
1. **Studio Ecosystem**: Shared infrastructure across all plugins
2. **Freemium Strategy**: WordPress.org free versions for all products
3. **Conditional Loading**: Pro features only load with valid license
4. **WordPress.org Compliance**: Free versions pass all marketplace checks
5. **Single Codebase**: Maintain both versions from one repository per product
6. **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add future plugins and modules
7. **Cross-Product Synergies**: Shared licensing and customer infrastructure

## 🚀 Current Environment Status

### Production-Ready Local Environment
- **Site Name**: "The Beginning is Finished" (Local by Flywheel)
- **Database**: MySQL with complete product catalog and licensing system
- **WordPress**: 6.8.1 with optimized configuration
- **Active Theme**: `vireo-designs` (custom professional theme)
- **Active Plugins**: WooCommerce + License Manager + Stripe + 6 Vireo plugins

### WordPress Admin Access
1. Run `/create-admin-fresh.php` (delete after use!)
2. Login: `admin` / `password`
3. Go to Plugins → Activate "PlugHaus Property Management"

### Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build free version (WordPress.org ready)
npm run build:free

# Build pro version
npm run build:pro

# Code standards
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=WordPress core/

# Asset compilation
npm run build

```

## 🌿 Git Workflow & Branch Management

### Branch Structure
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, releases only
- **`develop`**: Primary development branch with completed features
- **`feature/*`**: Individual feature development branches
- **`hotfix/*`**: Critical production fixes
- **`backup/*`**: Automated backup branches (auto-managed)

### Development Workflow

#### Standard Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Work on feature with regular commits
git add .
git commit -m "✨ Add new feature implementation"

# When feature is complete, merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-feature-name
git branch -d feature/new-feature-name
```

#### Daily Development Pattern
```bash
# Start each session by ensuring clean develop branch
git checkout develop
git status

# Make changes and commit regularly with descriptive messages
git add specific-files
git commit -m "🔧 FIX: Resolve specific issue with detailed description"

# The automated backup system creates safety branches automatically
# No manual backup branch management needed
```

### Commit Message Standards
- **✅ COMPLETE**: Major feature completion
- **🔧 FIX**: Bug fixes and corrections
- **✨ ADD**: New features or functionality
- **🚀 RELEASE**: Version releases
- **📝 DOCS**: Documentation updates
- **🧹 CLEANUP**: Code refactoring and cleanup
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Emergency fixes
- **🎯 TARGET**: Specific goal achievements

### Automated Systems
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic code quality checks (PHP syntax, file size, security)
- **Backup System**: Auto-creates backup branches on every commit to develop
- **Branch Cleanup**: Automatically manages backup branch retention (keeps latest 3)

### Branch Protection Rules
- **main**: Protected, requires pull request and review
- **develop**: Primary development, direct commits allowed for core team
- **backup/***: Auto-managed, do not modify manually

### Git Best Practices
1. **Commit Frequently**: Small, focused commits are better than large ones
2. **Descriptive Messages**: Always explain the "why" not just the "what"
3. **Clean History**: Use meaningful commit messages for future debugging
4. **Test Before Merge**: Ensure all changes work before merging to develop
5. **Stay Updated**: Regularly pull from develop before starting new work

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Restore from backup if needed
git checkout backup/develop_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_commit-hash
git checkout -b emergency-restore
git checkout develop
git reset --hard emergency-restore

# Hotfix for production issues
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
# Fix issue
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-issue
git tag v1.x.x
```

## 🔑 Licensing System

### Architecture
- **Free Version**: `check_pro_license()` returns `false`
- **Pro Version**: Validates against WooCommerce License Manager
- **API Endpoint**: `/wp-json/phls/v1/validate`
- **License Storage**: WordPress options table

### Key Files
- `pro/includes/licensing/class-phpm-license-manager.php` - Core license validation
- `plughaus-property-management.php:89-93` - License checking logic
- Build scripts automatically configure license checking per version

### License Validation Flow
1. User enters license key in Settings → Pro License
2. AJAX call to license validation endpoint
3. Server validates against VireoDesigns.com API
4. License status cached locally
5. Pro features enabled/disabled accordingly

## 📁 Key Files & Functions

### Main Plugin File
`plughaus-property-management.php` - Entry point with conditional loading:
```php
private function check_pro_license() {
    // Free version: return false;
    // Pro version: return PHPM_License_Manager::is_valid();
}
```

### Core Admin Classes
- `core/includes/admin/class-phpm-admin.php` - Main admin interface
- `core/includes/admin/class-phpm-admin-menu.php` - Menu structure
- `core/includes/admin/class-phpm-dashboard.php` - Dashboard widgets

### Pro Features
- `pro/includes/analytics/class-phpm-analytics.php` - Charts & metrics
- `pro/includes/automation/class-phpm-payment-automation.php` - Payment processing
- `pro/includes/licensing/class-phpm-license-manager.php` - License validation

### Data Models
- `core/includes/core/class-phpm-property.php` - Property management
- `core/includes/core/class-phpm-tenant.php` - Tenant management
- `core/includes/core/class-phpm-lease.php` - Lease management

## 🛠️ Build System

### Free Version Build (`npm run build:free`)
- Strips all pro directories and files
- Modifies main plugin file to disable pro features
- Creates WordPress.org-compliant ZIP
- Output: `dist/free/plughaus-property-management.zip`

### Pro Version Build (`npm run build:pro`)
- Includes all features (core + pro)
- Enables license validation in main plugin file
- Creates pro distribution ZIP
- Output: `dist/pro/plughaus-property-management-pro.zip`

### Build Automation
Both build scripts:
1. Clean previous builds
2. Copy appropriate files
3. Modify plugin headers and functionality
4. Compile assets
5. Create distribution ZIP
