### Key Design Principles
1. **Studio Ecosystem**: Shared infrastructure across all plugins
2. **Freemium Strategy**: WordPress.org free versions for all products
3. **Conditional Loading**: Pro features only load with valid license
4. **WordPress.org Compliance**: Free versions pass all marketplace checks
5. **Single Codebase**: Maintain both versions from one repository per product
6. **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add future plugins and modules
7. **Cross-Product Synergies**: Shared licensing and customer infrastructure

## 🚀 Development Environment

### Local Setup (Local by Flywheel)
- **Site Name**: "The Beginning is Finished"
- **Database**: MySQL (local/root/root)
- **WordPress**: Latest version
- **PHP**: 7.4+

### WordPress Admin Access
1. Run `/create-admin-fresh.php` (delete after use!)
2. Login: `admin` / `password`
3. Go to Plugins → Activate "PlugHaus Property Management"

### Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build free version (WordPress.org ready)
npm run build:free

# Build pro version
npm run build:pro

# Code standards
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=WordPress core/

# Asset compilation
npm run build
npm run watch
```

## 🔑 Licensing System

### Architecture
- **Free Version**: `check_pro_license()` returns `false`
- **Pro Version**: Validates against WooCommerce License Manager
- **API Endpoint**: `/wp-json/phls/v1/validate`
- **License Storage**: WordPress options table

### Key Files
- `pro/includes/licensing/class-phpm-license-manager.php` - Core license validation
- `plughaus-property-management.php:89-93` - License checking logic
- Build scripts automatically configure license checking per version

### License Validation Flow
1. User enters license key in Settings → Pro License
2. AJAX call to license validation endpoint
3. Server validates against VireoDesigns.com API
4. License status cached locally
5. Pro features enabled/disabled accordingly

## 📁 Key Files & Functions

### Main Plugin File
`plughaus-property-management.php` - Entry point with conditional loading:
```php
private function check_pro_license() {
    // Free version: return false;
    // Pro version: return PHPM_License_Manager::is_valid();
}
```

### Core Admin Classes
- `core/includes/admin/class-phpm-admin.php` - Main admin interface
- `core/includes/admin/class-phpm-admin-menu.php` - Menu structure
- `core/includes/admin/class-phpm-dashboard.php` - Dashboard widgets

### Pro Features
- `pro/includes/analytics/class-phpm-analytics.php` - Charts & metrics
- `pro/includes/automation/class-phpm-payment-automation.php` - Payment processing
- `pro/includes/licensing/class-phpm-license-manager.php` - License validation

### Data Models
- `core/includes/core/class-phpm-property.php` - Property management
- `core/includes/core/class-phpm-tenant.php` - Tenant management
- `core/includes/core/class-phpm-lease.php` - Lease management

## 🛠️ Build System

### Free Version Build (`npm run build:free`)
- Strips all pro directories and files
- Modifies main plugin file to disable pro features
- Creates WordPress.org-compliant ZIP
- Output: `dist/free/plughaus-property-management.zip`

### Pro Version Build (`npm run build:pro`)
- Includes all features (core + pro)
- Enables license validation in main plugin file
- Creates pro distribution ZIP
- Output: `dist/pro/plughaus-property-management-pro.zip`

### Build Automation
Both build scripts:
1. Clean previous builds
2. Copy appropriate files
3. Modify plugin headers and functionality
4. Compile assets
5. Create distribution ZIP
