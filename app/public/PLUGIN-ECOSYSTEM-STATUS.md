## üîß DEVELOPMENT CONTINUATION

### **For Framework Plugins (DealerEdge, Marina Manager, StorageFlow):**

**Implementation Pattern:**
1. **Create Missing Classes**: Follow TODO comments in main plugin files
2. **Use StudioSnap as Template**: Copy patterns for admin interfaces, AJAX handlers
3. **Implement Core Features**: Use the comprehensive architecture already planned
4. **Test Incrementally**: Each new class is safe due to defensive programming

**Example Next Implementation:**
```php
// Create: /plugins/dealeredge/core/includes/admin/class-de-admin.php
// Follow: StudioSnap's admin class pattern
// Result: Admin menu and dashboard automatically work
```
